We started by creating a base class Device, which contains common attributes and methods for all devices. This class includes attributes such as name (device name), price (price), stock (quantity in stock) and warrantyPeriod (warranty in months). We also added methods: displayInfo() to display information about the device, reduceStock() to reduce the number of goods in stock when buying, .

Then we created three subclasses, each of which inherits from Device. The first is Smartphone, which additionally includes the attributes screenSize (screen size) and batteryLife (battery life). It implements the methods makeCall(), which emulates a call, and installApp(), which emulates the installation of an application. The second subclass is Laptop, which adds the attributes ramSize (RAM size) and processorSpeed (processor frequency), as well as the methods runProgram(), which emulates running a program, and useKeyboard(), which emulates working with the keyboard. The third subclass is Tablet, which has the attributes screenResolution and weight (device weight). It has the browseInternet() methods, which emulate browsing the Internet, and useTouchscreen(), which represents interaction with the touchscreen.

After creating the devices, the shopping cart system was implemented in the form of the Cart class. It contains the items attribute, which stores the list of added products and their quantity, as well as the totalPrice, which reflects the total cost of the products in the cart. The class provides the addDevice() methods, which allows you to add devices to the cart if they are in stock, and printItems() to display the contents of the cart.
The relationship between the classes is built in such a way that Smartphone, Laptop, and Tablet inherit Device, which allows you to use common methods and override them if necessary. The Cart class manages the list of Device objects and provides user interaction with purchases. User interaction is organized through a menu where you can view the list of available devices, add them to the cart, check the contents of the cart, and complete the purchase. Thus, the code implements an object-oriented structure that demonstrates inheritance, encapsulation, and object management within the framework of an online electronics store system.
