This program is designed to manage employee data in a SQLite relational database. The program allows you to perform operations on employee data, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the employee table. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to use SQLite to store and manage employee data through a Java application.

The program works with a database that is automatically created when you run it. The database has an employee table that contains information about employees, such as name, position, salary, and hire date. Each employee is assigned a unique ID, which is used to search for and modify data. The Employee class represents an employee entity, and the EmployeeDAO class manages all database operations, such as adding a new employee, retrieving employee data by ID, updating employee information, and deleting a record.

The methods implemented in the EmployeeDAO class allow you to interact with the database: you can add new employees, get information about employees, update their data, or delete records. The program's main() method demonstrates all the basic operations with data: creating a new employee, retrieving information about an employee, updating his data, and deleting him.
